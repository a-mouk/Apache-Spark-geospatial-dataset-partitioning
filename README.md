# Apache-Spark-geospatial-dataset-partitioning
Process for creating balanced partitions of geospatial data, regardless of their distribution.

The process is automated, meaning that the users may select the number of partitions that they want and the process will always create balanced partitions. 

The key point is the use of sampling and quantiles.
